# Collections-Framework
Collections Framework and its basic Operation in java

1. List
2. Set
3. SortedSet
4. NavigableSet
5. Queue
6. Deque

The all above are interface and has too many abstract functions.
So when desired to extend any of these and create our own class become tedious as lot of function definition need to be defined.
So better to use any pre existing one for which no function definition required.
